# Day 14 – Light Revision (Sunday)

Today was a lighter day focused on revision and mental reset.

## What I did
- Read through previously written code
- Revised core concepts:
  - XOR logic (Single Number)
  - Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm (Majority Element)
  - General loop + variable tracking patterns
- Focused on understanding code flow rather than solving new problems

## Notes
- Learned that light revision days are important to avoid burnout
- Reading code helps solidify concepts without pressure
- Ready to resume normal problem-solving pace from Day 15

Consistency > intensity.
